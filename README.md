# Furniture Marketplace Project

This repository documents the journey of building a dynamic furniture marketplace. The following details the activities and milestones achieved during the first six days of development.

## Day 1: Laying the Foundation for Furniture Marketplace Journey

On Day 1, the focus was on laying a strong foundation for the furniture marketplace project. The primary tasks included:

- Defining the vision and purpose of the marketplace.
- Identifying the target audience and understanding their needs.
- Outlining essential features for the platform, such as user registration, product listing, search and filters, and a checkout process.
- Deciding on the tech stack to be used for the development (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.).

The goal was to ensure a solid understanding of the marketplace's direction and key functionalities before diving into the technical aspects.

## Day 2: Planning the Technical Foundation

Day 2 was dedicated to laying out the technical groundwork for the project. This involved:

- Finalizing the tech stack, including frontend (Next.js), backend solutions (Node.js/Express), and database choices (Sanity CMS for content management).
- Defining the architecture and workflow for handling product data, user interactions, and payments.
- Setting up basic project structure and initial codebase organization to ensure a scalable development process.

The technical foundation was carefully planned to ensure smooth development in the upcoming days.

## Day 3: Self-Validation Checklist for Day 1 and Day 2 and Migrating Data to Sanity Using API

On Day 3, I validated the progress made on Day 1 and Day 2 by checking the following:

- Ensured that the foundational aspects like the vision, features, and tech stack were well-defined and aligned with the project goals.
- Conducted a review of the technical setup, confirming that the architecture and codebase were correctly structured.

Additionally, I focused on migrating data to **Sanity** CMS using the API, including:

- Setting up API calls to fetch and populate product information, images, and other dynamic content.
- Testing the data flow between the backend and CMS to ensure content was correctly populated and displayed on the frontend.

## Day 4: Building Dynamic Frontend for the E-Commerce Website

On Day 4, I began developing the dynamic frontend for the e-commerce website. This included:

- Designing the layout using Tailwind CSS and ensuring responsive design across various screen sizes.
- Creating product pages, category filters, and search functionalities.
- Implementing the shopping cart and checkout process, integrating them with the backend to handle user selections and payments.

The focus was on building an engaging, user-friendly interface that would be easy to navigate.

## Day 5: Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Development

Day 5 was dedicated to testing, error handling, and backend development:

- Testing the functionality of dynamic pages, product search, and cart interactions.
- Implementing error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth user experience and catch potential bugs.
- Setting up the backend logic for handling user authentication, payments, and product management.

This day was all about ensuring the platform works as expected, handling edge cases, and ensuring backend stability.

## Day 6: Deployment Preparation and Staging Environment Setup

On Day 6, the focus shifted to preparing the project for deployment and setting up a staging environment:

- Finalizing the codebase and optimizing for performance (e.g., minimizing files, compressing images).
- Setting up a staging environment to test the marketplace in a production-like setting.
- Deploying the project to a live server using Vercel and ensuring everything works smoothly.
- Testing all features in the staging environment to ensure a seamless user experience.

The goal was to ensure the marketplace is ready for the public while keeping an eye on any potential issues that might arise.

 Conclusion

The first six days were crucial in laying the foundation, planning the technical aspects, and ensuring the development of the furniture marketplace is progressing smoothly. By the end of Day 6, the project is almost ready for public access, with a strong and well-tested platform in place.
